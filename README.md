# Character-Based Data Compression Tool

## Overview
This Java tool implements a custom frequency-based binary compression algorithm designed to minimize file sizes by reducing the representation of frequently used characters. It also includes a decryption tool to accurately reconstruct the original text from compressed binary data.

## Features
- **Text Compression**: Utilizes a frequency-based approach to compress text, significantly reducing the size of frequently used characters and optimizing overall storage.
- **Decryption Tool**: Reconstructs original text from compressed binary data using a custom-generated codebook, ensuring accurate recovery of the data.
- **Binary Tree Structure**: Implements a binary tree to optimize character encoding based on frequency, enhancing the efficiency of the compression process.
